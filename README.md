# Yotube-scrapping-using-python
In this project I have extracted all the data from a youtube channel using any video link of that channel. Later I stored that data in a csv file.
For this firstly I created a JSON file of that channel and later imported that Json file in my Jupyter notebook to extract the valuable info from that channel.
The first step that we need to do in this project is to generate the Youtube Data API key of youtube from google cloud console.
For running this project I used VS code to run .py files.
After running the program it asks if we have channel link or video link. We need to enter the link accordingly.
In this project I extracted the data of the channel named "Codin 101 with Steve"
I created JSON file and later I created the CSV file of all the data of that channel.
