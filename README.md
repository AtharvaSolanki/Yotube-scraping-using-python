# Yotube-scrapping-using-python
In this project I have extracted all the data from a youtube channel using any video link of that channel. Later I stored that data in a csv file.
For this firstly I created a JSON file of that channel and later imported that Json file in my Jupyter notebook to extract the valuable info from that channel.
The first step that we need to do in this project is to generate the Youtube Data API key of youtube from google cloud console.
